# Project-1 Student Survey Analysis
The student survey analysis explores survey data from CCMs' IT Department's annual survey for non computing majors currently enrolled in an introductory computing course. The goal of this project is to use exploratory data analysis to identify attributes that best map to an interest of taking more computing classes in the future. Among the data contained within this survey is student demographics(age, race/ethncity, gender), the class they are currently enrolled in and potential classes they would like to learn more about in the future. 

# Data Science Questions
This project poses and seeks to answer the following four questions:
  1.) Is there a pattern among the demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, age) of students who are currently enrolled in an introductory computer course? For example, are computing courses most popular with young white males ?

  2.) Is there an intro to computing class that seems to generate further willingness to take classes in the future more than others?

  3.) Is there a relationship between student major and a willingness to take more computer science classes. In other words, do some majors tend to display a greater degree of interest in computer science.

  4.) Is there a type of class students would like to learn more about more than others? Perhpaps AI more than app development, for example.

#Project Files
This repository contains three different files.

Student Survey Results 2024.csv is the that file contains the raw survey data from 2024 and is uncleaned
Student Survey Results 2024 Cleaned.csv is the cleaned survey data which was cleaned in the Student Survey Analysis I.ipynb file
Student Survey Analysis I.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file that both cleans and analyzes the data contained within the Student Survey Results 2024 Cleaned.csv file
